= API Usage

== Making Requests

=== Base URLs

The base URLs for the Sporting Technology API are - https://www.sportingtechnology.com/flow-api for live - https://development.sportingtechnology.com/flow-api for sandbox.

The API is only available over HTTPS.

=== Authentication

All requests must include your API key in the request header "AUTH_API_KEY".

== Formatting

=== Date Formats

All rest dates are formatted as ISO8601 with timezone information.

For rest calls that require dates, the format for this would be `YYYY-MM-DD`, where an example would look like `2019-10-02`.

Note that some fields for "time" may return as a date object (Unix epoch timestamp), where the date part is `01/01/1970`. It is important to take the timezone into consideration, as the date returned may not match the daylight savings time of the original date, where the date will need to be converted to the current date to get the correct time.

== Errors

Every error includes the HTTP status code, as well as error details.

=== Status codes

Some common response codes include:

|===
